# Documentation

Check out the [Documentation](https://lc4.gitbook.io/lavalink-client) for **Examples**, and **__detailled__ Docs**, and to figure out **how to get started**. *note: it's not fully done yet (see the docs)*

# Features

- üíØ Lavalink v4 Supported only (with Lavalink Plugins)

- ‚úÖ Player-Destroy Reasons like:
  - Channel got deleted, Player got disconnected...

- ‚ú® Choose able queue stores (maps, collections, redis, databases, ...)
  - You can create your own queueStore, thus make it easy to sync queues accross multiple connections (e.g. dashboard-bot)
  - Automated Queue Sync methods 
  - Automated unresolveable Tracks (save the queries as Partial Track Objects -> Fetch the tracks only once they are gonna play)

- üòç Included Filter & Equalizer Management

- üëç Multiple Player Options *for easier use*
  - onDisconnect -> Player Destroy / auto Reconnect
  - onEmptyQueue -> Player Destroy / leave After x Time
  - instaFixFilter -> seek the player after applying a filter, to instantly apply it's effect (only works for little-durational-songs)
  - applyVolumeAsFilter -> instead of using lavalink.volume, it uses lavalink.filters.volume which is much different!

- üõ°Ô∏è Lavalink Validations
  - It only let's you use the filters / plugins / sources, if Lavalink actually has it enabled

- üõ°Ô∏è Client Validations
  - Allows you to whitelist links and even blacklist links / words / domain names, so that it doesn't allow requests you don't want!
  - Checks almost all Lavalink Requests for out of bound errors, right before the request is made to prevent process breaking errors. 

- üßë‚Äçüíª Memory friendly and easy style
  - Only the required data is displayed, and the store-way & types match Lavalink#IMPLEMENTATION.md

- üòò Automated Handlings
  - Skips the songs, on TrackEnd, TrackStuck, TrackError, 
  - Destroys the player on channeldelete
  - Pauses / resumes the player if it get's muted / unmuted (server-wide) [soon]
  - ...

- üòÅ Much much more!

# UpdateLog

## **Version 1.2.0**
- Added `player.stopPlaying()`: When executed it **clears the Queue** and **stops playing**, **without destroying the Player**
- Adjusted `Player.skip()`
  - Added `throwError` Property to: `player.skip(skipTo?:number = 0, throwError?:boolean = true)`.
    - If throwError = false, and no more tracks are in the queue, it won't throw an error and "ignore it". same thing as stopPlaying.
- Added all Events and Methods from the [SponsorBlock Plugin](https://github.com/topi314/Sponsorblock-Plugin).
  - It also validates if the plugin is in the bot, in order so that you can use the functions:
  - `player.getSponsorBlock()` / `node.getSponsorBlock()`
  - `player.setSponsorBlock(segments:SponsorBlockSegment[])` / `node.setSponsorBlock(segments:SponsorBlockSegment[])`
  - `player.deleteSponsorBlock()` / `node.deleteSponsorBlock()`
    - That Plugin adds following **Events** to the **Manager**: `"SegmentsLoaded"`, `"SegmentSkipped"`, `"ChapterStarted"`, `"ChaptersLoaded"`
- Example Bot show example in autoplayFunction how to "disable" / "enable" Autoplay with bot data variables.
- Added `ManagerOptions#emitNewSongsOnly`. If set to true, it won't emit "trackStart" Event, when track.loop is active, or the new current track == the previous (current) track. 
- Added `ManagerOptions#linksBlacklist` which allows user to specify an array of regExp / strings to match query strings (for links / words) and if a match happens it doesn't allow the request (blacklist) 
- Added `ManagerOptions#linksWhitelist` which allows user to specify an array of regExp / strings to match query strings (for links only) and if a match does NOT HAPPEN it doesn't allow the request (whitelist)
- Added `ManagerOptions#linksAllowed` if set to false, it does not allow requests which are links
- Moved `ManaagerOptions#debugOptions` to `ManaagerOptions#advancedOptions.debugOptions`

### **Version 1.2.1**
- Adjusted `player.stopPlaying()`
  - There are now following parameters. `stopPlaying(clearQueue:boolean = true, executeAutoplay:boolean = false)`.
    - On Default it now clears the queue and stops playing. Also it does not execute Autoplay on default. IF you want the function to behave differently, you can use the 2 states for that. 
  - Fixed that it looped the current track if repeatmode === "track" / "queue". (it stops playing and loop stays)
- Implemented a `parseLavalinkConnUrl(connectionUrl:string)` Util Function.
  - It allows you to parse Lavalink Connection Data of a Lavalink Connection Url. 
  Pattern: `lavalink://<nodeId>:<nodeAuthorization(Password)>@<NodeHost>:<NodePort>`
  - Note that the nodeId and NodeAuthorization must be encoded via encodeURIComponents before you provide it into the function.
  - The function will return the following: `{ id: string, authorization: string, host: string, port: number }`
  - Example: `parseLavalinkConnUrl("lavalink://LavalinkNode_1:strong%23password1@localhost:2345")` will give you:
  `{ id: "LavalinkNode_1", authorization: "strong#password1", host: "localhost", port: 2345 }`
    - Note that the password "strong#password1" when encoded turns into "strong%23password1". For more information check the example bot

### **Version 2.0.0**
- Lavalink v4 released, adjusted all features from the stable release, to support it in this client!
```diff

# How to load tracks / stop playing has changed for the node.updatePlayer rest endpoint the Client handles it automatically
- await player.node.updatePlayer({ encodedTrack?: Base64|null, track?: Track|UnresolvedTrack, identifer?: string });
+ await player.node.updatePlayer({ track: { encoded?: Base64|null, identifier?: string }, clientTrack?: Track|UnresolvedTrack });

# To satisfy the changes from lavalink updatePlayer endpoint, player play also got adjusted for that (Most users won't need this feature!)
- await player.play({ encodedTrack?: Base64|null, track?: Track|UnresolvedTrack, identifer?: string });
+ await player.play({ track: { encoded?: Base64|null, identifier?: string }, clientTrack?: Track|UnresolvedTrack });
# However it' still recommended to do it like that:
# first add tracks to the queue
+ await player.queue.add(Track: Track|UnresolvedTrack|(Track|UnresolvedTrack)[]);
# then play the next track from the queue
+ await player.play();

# Node Resuming got supported
# First enable it by doing:
+ await player.node.updateResuming(true, 360_000);
# then when reconnecting to the node add to the node.createeOptions the sessionId: "" of the previous session
# and after  connecting the nodeManager.on("resumed", (node, payload, players) => {}) will be executed, where you can sync the players!

# Node Options got adjusted # It's a property not a method should be treated readonly
+ node.resuming: { enabled: boolean, timeout: number | null }; 

# Player function got added to stop playing without disconnecting
+ player.stopPlaying(clearQueue:boolean = true, executeAutoplay:boolean = false); 

# Node functions for sponsorBlock Plugin (https://github.com/topi314/Sponsorblock-Plugin) got added
+ deleteSponsorBlock(player:Player)
+ setSponsorBlock(player:Player, segments: ["sponsor", "selfpromo", "interaction", "intro", "outro", "preview", "music_offtopic", "filler"])
# only works if you ever set the sponsor blocks once before
+ getSponsorBlock(player:Player)
# Corresponding nodeManager events got added:
+ nodeManager.on("ChapterStarted");
+ nodeManager.on("ChaptersLoaded");
+ nodeManager.on("SegmentsLoaded");
+ nodeManager.on("SegmentSkipped");
# Filters sending got supported for filters.pluginFilters key from lavalink api: https://lavalink.dev/api/rest.html#plugin-filters
# Native implementation for lavaSearch plugin officially updated https://github.com/topi314/LavaSearch
# Native implementation for lavaSrc plugin officially updated https://github.com/topi314/LavaSrc including floweryTTS
# couple other changes, which aren't noticeable by you.

# Lavalink track.userData got added (basically same feature as my custom pluginInfo.clientData system)
# You only get the track.userData data through playerUpdate object
```
In one of the next updates, there will be more queueWatcher options and more custom nodeevents to trace 

Most features of this update got tested, but if you encounter any bugs feel free to open an issue!

- Enforce link searches for users with following searchPlatform Options: "http" | "https" | "link" | "uri"
  - Additionally strongend the code behind that
- Added searchPlatform for local tracks (aka files on the lavalink server...): "local"
